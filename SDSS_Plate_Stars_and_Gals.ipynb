    "Hello and welcome to your first step into working with real astronomy data. This interactive-notebook should guide you through some basic programing, and allow you to learn from the largest astronomical dataset in existence! Almost all of the difficult programing is done behind the scenes by the accompanying PrimaryPlates.Py file, so you can focus on exploring and playing with the data. "

    "Before we begin with the lab, it might be helpful to know the basics of Jupyter notebooks and python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a computer programming language, and notebooks are applications (or apps) that allow you to run snippets of code and keep a record of your work - just like a Lab book. They are also useful ways to guide users through a pre-made work flow, and  that is the way we will use them here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are divided into little boxes called cells. In our case we will use _code_ cells or _markdown_ cells. Code cells interpret and execute code, and markdown cells allow you to write down text - just as I am doing now. You don't really need to worry about this, but the important part is: **To run the code in a cell press shift+enter to execute (just pressing enter will give you a new line).** You can also clikc on the 'run' button at the top of the page. You'll need to run each of the cells in the notebook **in order**. If you do it our of order, then things can get broken or a little messy.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there's an error, you can try re-running the cell (click on the cell and hold shift+enter) or you can reset the entire notebook by double tapping the 0 key on your keyboard (or by clicking on the restart kernal button).\n",

    "* [Python for Astronomers](https://prappleizer.github.io/index.html) A introduction to Python, aimed at complete beginners. Chapters 2, 4 and 7 are a good starting place for working with astronomical data. You can download the interactive tutorials and upload them onto SciServer to run them (select Python 2 if SciServer asks you for a Kernerl when you open the tutorial).\n",

    "* [Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/) First stop reference for basic tasks (looping, string formating, classes, functions, etc). A good place to look for specific examples. Sections 3, 4 and 5 are the most relevant for this module, but go beyond what you will need here. \n",
    "* [Python Standard Library](http://docs.python.org/2/library/) The definitive reference for everything Python can do out of the box. Many common and not so common tasks are already taken care of. Not suitable for the complete beginner."

    "  Here we have three different methods of looking at the data. Each of these were gathered in different ways and each of these are extremely important for astronomers to use when looking at the sky\n",
    "    \n",
    "  **Distance**:\n",
    "  Distance to objects can be kind of hard to measure. You can't just take a measuring tape to the nearest star or galaxy, so astronomers have had to get a little clever. There are three main ways of measuring distance to stars. These are through *Parallax*, *Standard Candles* and *Redshift*. Each of these methods has their benifits and their drawbacks. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/41434123.\">this video </a> has a great explanation of all of these distance measurements, but I'll also explain some of them here. *Parallax* was one of the first methods that astronomers used to figure out distances and it's still used today. In math class you might have learned some of the properties of right triangles; Namely, that if you know the length of one of the sides and you know any of the angles, then you can figure out the lengths of all the other sides. Now, as an experiment, stick your arm out and raise your finger, then use your other hand to cover one eye while keeping your finger in one place. Switch which eye you're covering and you might notice that your finger seems to move side to side. This apparent shift in position is caused because your eyes are an inch or two apart in your face. Astronomers noticed a similar shift in the stars as the Earth orbits the sun. Measuring the angle of this shift, astronomers could use the distance between the Earth and the Sun to caculate the distance to the stars! For a more in depth (and with visual aids) explanation, go to <a href=\"https://lco.global/spacebook/distance/parallax-and-distance-measurement/#:~:text=As%20the%20Earth%20orbits%20the,motion%20is%20called%20stellar%20parallax.\">this link</a>. *Parallax* is great for close objects, but becomes more difficult the farther away the object is. For really far objects, you'd need to use a different method. *Standard Candles* are a little bit different. As will be explained a bit later; how bright an object seems depends on how far away it is. If you know how bright an object is supposed to be, which astronomers call luminosity, then you can figure out how far away an object is by looking at how bright it appears to be here on Earth, which astronomers call Flux. You might be wondering how astronomers would know the luminosity, how bright an object is supposed to be. Well, there are a couple of special objects that get brighter and dimmer over time. The time it takes to do this is directly related to their luminosity. It's fairly easy to measure the time between dimming, which then makes it easy enough to measure the luminosity and use that to find the distance! Still, though, really far objects like galaxies, that's still not enough. For that, astronomers need *Redshift*. It was discovered, not too long ago, that the universe is constantly expanding. That means that galaxies are actually moving away from us and how fast they move depends on how fa away they are from us. As they move aways, it looks like they are getting redder, due to something called the Doppler effect. By looking at how red a galaxy has gotten, you can figure out how fast it's moving. By knowing how fast they're moving, you can figure out how far away they are.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  **Mass**: Mass is roughly how much physical stuff there is in one place. This is pretty hard to measure, but it can be done through knowing some other features that depend on mass. The true brightness, or luminosity, of an object is related to the amount of light that it gives off. This works pretty well for stars to figure out their mass. Another indirect way of measuring mass is through gravity. Gravity, which is affected by mass, is what causes planets and stars to orbit eachother. Seeing how fast things orbit can tell you how massive the overall object is! This is great for looking at galaxies, which have lots of mass.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    " **Brightness**: Here we're using two different types of brightness. There's *Flux*, which is how bright an object looks from here on Earth. Then there's *Luminosity*, which is how bright the object actually is. *Flux* depends on how far away the object is from Earth, while *luminosity* depneds only on the properties of the object itself. Because of this, astronomers are usually a lot more interested in *luminosity*, since that tells us more about the object that we're looking at. \n",

    "Now with all of that out of the way, you hopefully have a better idea of how to tell two objects apart in space. But, that still begs the question of what is a star and what is a galaxy? You might have been able to figure it out by now, but a galaxy is just a bunch of stars together! That's why they're so much more massive and so much more luminous. The stars are all orbit around the centre of the galaxy (just like how the planets orbit the Sun). All the stars we were looking at are within the Milky Way Galaxy. The other galaxies all need to be super far away compared to the stars so that they don't get caught and start orbiting the centre of the Milky Way. \n",
