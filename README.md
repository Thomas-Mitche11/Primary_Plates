How to set up the code:
First, you'll want to go to https://apps.sciserver.org/. This website acts as an in-browser coding environment. It's also connected to all of the data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (what the plate was used for) and hosts all of that data. You'll need to create an account using an email address. 
After you've made your account, you'll want to log in. You should be taken to the dashboard, and from there, you'll want to click the button that says 'Compute' either on the bottom or by clicking the drop down boxes.

After that, you'll want to click the green button that says 'Create container'. You'll need to give it a name at the top. You can name it anything that you want and then leave the rest of the defaults as they are and click 'Create' at the bottom.
It should pop up on the screen and you'll want to click the little green arrow to start the container, and then click on the name to go to the next step.

 You'll want to hit 'Storage', then your username, then 'persistent'
Once you're here (you can double check that you did it right by seeing if the folder says '/Storage / [Username] / persistent') you'll want to upload the all files from Plate_Workshop (Make sure that you unzip the folder first). There's an upload button in the top right corner.
After the files are uploaded, open up SDSS_Plate_Stars_and_Gals.ipynb by clicking on it and it should have instructions and explanations for everything.
